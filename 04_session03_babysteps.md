## What Is a constraint?

. . .

<span style="color:red;">COUNTABLE NOUN</span>

> A **constraint** is something that limits or controls what you can do.

## It slows us down

## So we focus on one aspect

## Taking Baby Steps 👼

1. Setup version control, commit your setup.
1. Set a timer for 2 minutes when you start.
1. Write exactly one test. When the timer rings:
    * <span style="color:red;">test is red</span> => delete (revert) and restart.
    * <span style="color:green;">test is green</span> => continue (commit).
1. Restart timer and repeat from 2
    * no discussions in between timers
1. Use the same procedure for Refactoring!

## Find a Partner! 👀

*"Pair programming is a conversation between people, where the byproduct is code."*

---

## Retrospective 🏟️

<!-- 10 minutes / additional question: How did you achieve it?-->

* How often did you revert?
* What was the shortest green step?
