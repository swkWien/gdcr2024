## Evil Pairing

*aka Find the Loophole*

- One person writes tests.
- Other person writes implementation.
  - the implementation is purposely wrong that still makes the tests green.
- Both keep the code very clean all the time.
- Switch after half session.

## Demo 💻

## Fizzbuzz

The player designated to go first says the number **"one"**,
and the players then count upwards in turn  
(**"one"**, **"two"**, ...).

However, any number divisible by **three** is replaced by the word **"fizz"** and any number divisible by **five** by the word **"buzz"**.  

(**"one"**, **"two"**, **"Fizz"**, ...).

Numbers divisible by **both three and five** (i.e. divisible by fifteen) become **"fizz buzz"**.

## Find a Partner! 👀

*"Pair programming is a conversation between people, where the byproduct is code."*

**We will give a sign to switch roles!**
