## What is a Coderetreat? 🤔

> A day of deliberate practice and learning.

---

### Deliberate Practice and Learning?

- Not about getting things done
- Doing things differently
- Try out new ideas
- Do it right!

---

### How does it work?

- We work on the same problem repeatedly.
- Try out different approaches.
- Learn from each other.

Practice - reflect - improve! 🥳
